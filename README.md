This is a project on the analysis and prediction of global weather trends using machine learning techniques. The dataset Global Weather Repository.csv contains daily weather data from locations around the world, with over 40 features, including temperature, precipitation, and air quality indices. Major steps involved in the workflow include cleaning and preprocessing. There was missing values handling with imputation, outlier removal through both Z-score and IQR, and numerical feature normalization. In the EDA phase, there was a representation of trends, correlations, and patterns through histograms, box plots, and time series graphs of temperature, precipitation, and air quality. Advanced EDA included anomaly detection by means of Z-score and Isolation Forest techniques applied to identify high intensity fluctuations in temperature and air quality.

In time series forecasting, the project implemented last_updated feature, using three models: ARIMA, LSTM, and Facebook Prophet, for evaluating the model against RMSE, MAE, and MAPE scores. For improving the accuracy of forecasting, ensemble models were used, combining various models. It further included some special analyses like climate trend assessments, environmental impact analysis, feature importance using Random Forest and SHAP values, and spatial analysis through geographical visualization. This study identified the most relevant observations of robust seasonal variability of temperature and precipitation, large positive correlations of the increase in temperatures with degrading air quality, improved forecasting with ensemble models' reliability, and anomalies of such extreme fluctuations in temperature and surges in pollutants. 

To implement this project, one simply opens the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab and runs each step of the code, which then loads the dataset and analyzes the results through visualizations and tables.
